    Making speculative Fiction Speculative

Notes:

    The lines between sci-fi, fantacy, horror and the likes have become blurred and blended
    Emotional attatchment to characters(writer and reader) are important
    Starting with an idea and building around it is a good start
    
Exercise:

     1) Pick a topic with random image/word generator
        My pic: Aligator on the water (crystal clear reflection
        
     2) narrow in: pick single element from picture
        reflective water
        
     3) repeat 1 & 2 for a cross idea
        Woman in veil with butterflies
        Wings of a butterfly
        
     5) How did the pictures connect. (did this first this time around)
            
            Butterfly wings tend to be (or at least I interpert them) as mirror images of each other with the mirror like water
            reflecting back.
            
            Butterflies can be omens for good or bad. can also be good luck. 
            
            With the new season of stranger things, maybe the butterflies help guide people to an upside down like universe.   
        
     4) blend the two into the genre in mind. 
     
            Mirrors, what a crazy concept. A view into another world, The other dimension, the one you never want to be stuck in. 
            Most people avoid the beauty and majisty of the butterflies in an attempt to stay here, safe, in the world of us humans.
            Those like me, we get trapped in that beauty taunted with the the way they say look here, follow me. Me myself, I havae made
            it my job to travel between the worlds, befriend the butterflies as they lead you through, and there is a chance they hang
            around long enough to bring you back once buisiness is through.

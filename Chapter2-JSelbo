Which Speculative genre to choose? (my fave is fantasy with some grim's style horror elements)

About the author:

    PHD screenwriter in TV, movies and the works. Works in the journal of screenwriting and at a University in California

Notes:

    Genre, tends to be the first thing a person knows about your book/film
    
    Easy to disappoint if your work doesn't fit into the slot you proposed it was
    
    Especially so with speculative genres because of the fan base
    
    Without the establishment of genre, one may find it dificult to pick the right
    themes and plots for their stories, might not get them to pop or stand out from the others
    
    differnet subgenres, that intercross in speculative fiction, come together to drive and progress 
    the story or add diversity or flair or extra challenges as it progresses.
    
    Sums up with the fact that picking a genre and then maybe 1-3 sub-genres may help narrow in a plot point
    and drive the story to establish reasonings behind decisions or character arcs that may not 
    have connected in the past.
